# Snake-game
A classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a clean UI, a responsive layout, real-time score tracking, and smooth game logic. The game is played on an HTML5 &lt;canvas> element and uses JavaScript to handle the snake movement, collisions, food generation, and game reset.
